# Buttery CLI

A file-based mechanism (similar to Remix routes) for creating a fully typed and documented CLI.

## Description

This CLI tool simplifies the process of creating command-line interfaces (CLIs) by dynamically generating commands from files within a specified folder. It's designed to streamline CLI development by automating command creation, making it easy to define, develop, and build custom Typescript CLIs; all driven by established industry conventions.

This tool and mechanism abstracts away all of the complexity needed to create CLIs; from the hash-bangs to the `argv` processing... the Buttery CLI makes it dead simple to create complex CLIs at scale.

## Conventions

WIP

## Todos

- Create `dev` scripts for writing the CLI
- Create `dev` CLI command for developing
- Create `build` CLI Command building
- Finish hard typing the `options` and `args` based upon the command file
- Semantic release
