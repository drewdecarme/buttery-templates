     * ## Description
     * The integer that will regulate the visual harmony of the application by enforcing strict spacing requirements
     *
     * ## Overview
     * The point grid system is a framework that helps you place and arrange elements in your design with precision.
     * The general premise is that whenever you create space between elements, it should be divisible by four (4, 8, 12, 16, etc.).
     *
     * One of the most noticeable advantages of the 4-point grid system is that it acts as compass to enhance visual hierarchy and organization within your design.
     * Following the 4-point grid creates a sense of order and structure. Elements don't just sit on the canvas â€” they align
     * with purpose and intent by following the grid lines with precision.
     *
     * This draws the user's attention to pivotal points and accentuates the key components for a clean and well-orchestrated visual flow.
     * The result? Designs that not only look appealing but also feel intuitive and fluid to navigate.
     *
     * Setting this value really depends upon the purpose of your application. As a general rule of thumb
     * if you're creating a marketing website, then an `8pt` system might be the way to go since white space,
     * negative space, etc.. is important to make your content easily consumable. If you're building something like
     * Figma, Webflow, a Bloomberg Terminal or any other screen intensive tool, you might want a `4pt` grid system to compress space and manage
     * it a little more granularly.
