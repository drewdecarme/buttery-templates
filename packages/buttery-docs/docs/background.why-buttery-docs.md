# Why Buttery Docs?

Before you read on, I know what you're thinking. Ah yes... another documentation generator; and what you're thinking is indeed correct. This is just another document generator. But as with all things open source, **this aims to provide something a little different and albeit a little less complex than others out there.**

## The state of documentation

## The need

The need was simple. I needed a _very_ easy way of creating documentation for various endeavors and I needed all of my documentation in the same directory as my project.

- The directory had to be in the same folder as my other project

## The problems

### Config overload

### Complex routing

### Convoluted setup

- too much configuration. CLI first and then configure later
- SEO & SSR first. Vite second, profit

## Aimed solutions

**Buttery Docs** aims to get you started with a full server rendered documentation website with just a few conventions and potentially zero configuration (I'll get to that last point in a second)

### Docs first, config second

### Dead simple routing

### Extensive CLI

### Multiple build targets
