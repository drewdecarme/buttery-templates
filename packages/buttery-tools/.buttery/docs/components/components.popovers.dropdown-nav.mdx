# DropdownNav

An abstraction that that extends upon the `useDropdown` hook to easily
add accessible, keyboard and mouse aware, SSR enabled navigation dropdowns.

These dropdowns can be as simple as a an unordered list with some links or as complex
as one of those super dropdowns you see on really fancy technical websites.

{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-nav/examples/DropdownNav.example.tsx" */}

This specific abstraction provides support when you would like to send the user to another page.

> **NOTE:** It's important to note that this should be used when you want the user **to go somewhere**; not to **do something**.
> If you're looking to provide some functionailty that isn't a navigation event, then you should consider using the
> the [DropdownMenu](./components.popovers.dropdown-nav.mdx) component.

## Usage

The `<DropdownNav />` and the `useDropdownNav` component and hook attempt to provide
an out of the box way to easily and simply add any type of navigational dropdown that you
would need for a navbar or a side nav bar.

The below implementation is the `useDropdownNav` at it's most basic.

{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-nav/examples/DropdownNavBarebones.example.tsx" */}

The `useDropdownNav` hook has the exact same API as the `useDropdown` hook except that it
requires an ID in order to link the `<button />` to the `<DropdownNav />` componnet.

## Why not just `useDropdown`?

The `useDropdownNav` hook allows for all of the same options that the `useDropdown` hook allows for
but the `useDropdownNav` hook and the `<DropdownNav />` component enahnce the existing functionality
to make the nodes fully acessible as well as automatically add the keyboard events that users expect
from any navbar experience.

The `useDropdownNav` hook is just an extension of the `useDropdown` hook to make reptetive elemnets of
a web experience just a little bit easier and faster to implement.

And this is true of the other `useDropdownXXXX` hooks and components.

## Why not just `useDropdownMenu`?

Simply put, it not accessible or SEO friendly. The `useDropdownMenu` (as explained in the documentation) employs
the use of portals and dynamic node creation to:

1. Render the menu outside the context of the HTML heirarchy
2. Focus the user's attention to the first actionable Node
3. Potentially reduce the client bundle down by code-splitting the content of the popover.

All of the above points aim to remove the content of the `<DropdownMenu />` from the DOM until it
is needed.

### SEO

On the contrary, [navigation menus need to be SEO friendly](https://www.concretecms.com/about/blog/web-design/the-ultimate-guide-to-navigation-bars-and-web-menus#why-navigation-matters) by always existing in the DOM so web crawlers
can index the internal page links and develop a mapped understading of how the site flows. If the navigation
menu is hidden before any user interaction, the site rank could fall due to cralwers inability to programatically
navigate the site.

### User Experience

Imagine trying to shop for a car where you can't see any the car you want until you walk up to the parking spot
that the car is sitting in. You don't get a good overview of what's in the lot until you actually roll up to the spot.
This makes navigating that lot or viewing what car you want almost impossible and would most likely cause you to leave
without even attemping to make a purchase.

An navigation menu works the same way where since it always exsits in the DOM, screen readers and other
assitive technologies aren't excluded from the same experience that fully abled users are. Assitive technologies
can parse and read the information that it needs to give _everybody_ the same experience.

## Examples

### Barebones

This is the most basic instance you can get (that is without any styling)
{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-nav/examples/DropdownNavBarebones.example.tsx" */}

### Nested Menus

Creating accessible menus is incredibly simple. Create another component that uses both the `<DropdownNav />` component and the hook to spread
the controls over the target and dropdown. The Popover API handles the `topLevel` instance for you.
{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-nav/examples/DropdownNavNestedNav.example.tsx" */}

### Recursive Menus from Trees

At some points, you might recieve a structure as a nested tree. This is extreamly common when dealing with content management
systems like [Prismic]() or [Contentful](). In order to parse these and surface your nested sub-menus, you can write a recursive
component that will render itself as far deep as the menus will go.

Consider this structure:

```ts
type MenuTree = {
  name: string;
  root: string;
  links: { display: string; to?: string; menu?: MenuTree }[];
};
```

This type references itself when there is a `menu` option in the links. We can write a component that
can process this type effectively while using the `<DropdownNav />` component and associated hook.
{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-nav/examples/DropdownNavRecursion.example.tsx" */}
