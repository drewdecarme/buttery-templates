# `useDynamicNode`

A hook that returns controls for dynamically creating a node at in the `<body />` node of the DOM.

This hook is perfect for creating arbitrary `div`s in the body to attach React Portals to.

## Usages

The `useDynamicNode` is a utility hook to separate out the logic of node creation from portal management.
In order to promote the most accessible experience, Portals should be attached to nodes at the root of the
document, or in this case the `body` node. In order to create the best developer experience, this hook replaces
the need to statically add and manage `div`'s with specific IDs in order to attach portals.

The hook creates a `div` with a random GUID and then adds it as the child of the `body` node in the DOM.
The example is designed to display how easy it is to manage accessible portals using the `createPortal` API
from React.

The state of the hook manages when to use the `destroyNode` function.

> Remember to always use the `destroyNode` funciton returned by the hook to destroy the reference to the
> the node and remove it from the DOM. Otherwise the node won't be released from memory to be garbage collected
> and the node will just persist at the root.
