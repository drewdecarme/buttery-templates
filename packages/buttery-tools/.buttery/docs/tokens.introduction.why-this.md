honestly, css is more than just a few utility classes. It takes finesse and theory and should be understood before wielding. Looking at you tailwind.

## who is this for?

- The lead UI expert that is tired of writing the same components over and over again but who has to subscribe to legacy or opionated sylting methodollgoies
- the Startup who wants full control over their styles
- the design agency that needs something to start with but has a few in house people that understand CSS
- The freelancer who hired a designer and needs components to move quick
- The moonlighter who can't waste time on repeating things; but also has their strong opinions on scale
- The documentation engineer who wants to move quick and write docs inline to their apps
