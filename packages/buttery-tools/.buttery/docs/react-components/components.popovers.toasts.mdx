# Toasts

A semantically correct, accessible and SSR ready hook and component
for creating completely custom toast messages to incicate the status
of some user initiated action.

{/* example:"lib/components/popovers/toast/examples/Toast.example.tsx" */}

## Usage

At it's very basic, the `<Toast />` and the `useToast` component help you
imperatively launch toast messages from anywhere in the app.

The `<Toaster />` component takes in a custom defined component that shares the
same props as the options that you pass the `create` function returned from
the `useToast` hook. This gives you complete control over the options that
you pass the toast component that you create yourself.

{/* example:"lib/components/popovers/toast/examples/ToastBestPractice.example.tsx" */}

The `<Toaster />` component can be defined anywhere in the app that it doesn't use
conventional "react" means for passing data back and fourth to the toast itself. The
`<Toaster />` uses a DOM API called the [Mutation Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver).
You can [read more about the interal workings of the `Toaster` component in the `<Toaster />` API
documentation](#toaster-)

> **NOTE**: A best practice is to centerally define your `<Toaster />` and the `useToast`
> hook in your app and then re-export another differntly named isntance of the `useToast` hook
> that you can use anywhere with the options that you have already defined.

## Styling

## Examples

### Barebones

This is the most basic instance you can get (that is without any styling)
{/* example:"lib/components/popovers/DropdownMenu/examples/DropdownMenuBarebones.example.tsx" */}

### Centerally re-declaring `useToast`

### Launching in promises

### Multiple toasters

There might be certain instances where you want to create multiple instances of
the toaster to support more complex toasts and isolate them from the general toasts
in your application.

For this use case, you can create multiple `<Toaster />` components and add `id`s to
the toaster and the `useToast` hook. The result will be transparent to the user but
this might provide some more isolated DX for certain pieces of the app.

{/* example:"lib/components/popovers/toast/examples/ToastMultipleToasters.example.tsx" */}

This example consolidates the `ToastComponent` for each toaster inline into the `ToastComponent`
prop of the toaster. To ensure that the types matchup, the `<Toaster />` is a generic functional
component that can take the ToastComponentProps as a generic.

> **Monorepo NOTE**: This method also allows you to use the Toast component across multiple
> packages to support different use cases, but when used in one app, the user will not be able
> to discerne any difference. (e.g. it will look like the same toast mechanism regardless
> of where it's used)

Each toaster can share the same styles since their references to props are maintained
in a completely different mechanism
