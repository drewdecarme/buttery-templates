# Drawer

An type of modal dialog that extends the [Modal Component](./components.modals.modal.mdx) to explicity provide
a few pre-defined props to easily style and implement flyout drawers.

{/* fence:"/lib/components/modals/Drawer/examples/DrawerBarebones.example.tsx" */}

This component is great for easily adding complex elements such as comment windows,
e-commerce cart previews and management, detail panes for tabular data, etc...

In the above example, you can see that it only takes a few animation declarations to achieve
flyouts.

> **Note:** It's important to note that the `<Drawer />` component sits as an interface
> on top of the `<Modal />` component and functions exactly the same. You can create a
> modal drawer without the explicit use of the `<Drawer />` component however, it will
> take a little more effort.

## Usage

Since the Drawer extends the Modal component, it inherits all of the same properties that
the Modal component does. Howerever, the `<Drawer />` component adds another prop called
`dxOrientation` which adds a few classes to make it easy to style.

In addition, you can use the `dxSize` prop of the modal to size the drawer. Ultmiatley,
the drawer is nothing more than a small wrapper around the Modal component to make the DX
a little better.

Below is an example that doesn't apply any styling at all. Try to notice the similarities to
the a default `Modal Dialog`

{/* example:"/lib/components/modals/Drawer/examples/Drawer.example.tsx" */}

You'll notice above that the drawer, when opened, is the default style of a Modal Dialog.

## Installation

```bash
# yarn
yarn add @buttery/components

# npm
npm install @buttery/components
```

## Basic Example

The below example is what you would most likely see in the wild. It includes a modal header, scrollable body, and a footer that
contains a close and action button. It has minimal styles but attempts to show you what you can do with those styles.

{/* example:"/lib/components/modals/Modal/examples/ModalBasic.example.tsx" */}

Unlike other Headless UI libraries, Buttery Components only exports hooks and basic components you need to use relatively complex
functionality. You might think that there would be a `<ModalHeader /> `, `<ModalBody />`, and `<ModalFooter />` components but
that offers too much opinion on how those components should be implemented and also makes an uncessary complex abstraction to interface
when consuming the components.

Instead, it's up to the user to style those internal components in the modal however they see fit.

## Styling

### CSS-in-JS

### Style Objects

## Examples

### Barebones

### Animation

### Different sizes

### Orientation

The orientation is what ultimately dictates what direction the drawer will open up and then subsuquntly close.
The `dxOrientation` is the class that is added to the `<Modal />` component and is what you'll be use to
style.

#### Slide right

A drawer that slides from the left to the right.
{/* example:"/lib/components/modals/Drawer/examples/DrawerOrientationSlideRight.example.tsx" */}

#### Slide left

A drawer that slides from the right to the left.
{/* example:"/lib/components/modals/Drawer/examples/DrawerOrientationSlideLeft.example.tsx" */}

#### Slide-up

A drawer that slides up from the bottom.
{/* example:"/lib/components/modals/Drawer/examples/DrawerOrientationSlideUp.example.tsx" */}

#### Slide-down

A drawer that slides down from the top.
{/* example:"/lib/components/modals/Drawer/examples/DrawerOrientationSlideDown.example.tsx" */}

### Stacking

### Code splitting drawer content

### Styling the `:backdrop`

### Setting internal state before opening

## APIs

### `<Drawer />`

### `useDrawer`
