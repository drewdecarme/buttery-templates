# `useDropdown`

Extends the `usePopover` hook to turn any node into a custom, accessible dropdown component inclusive of
custom positioning, gaps, arrows, and keyboard navigation.

This hook is great for easily turning any node into a context menu, navbar menu etc...

## Usages

The `useDropdown` extends the `usePopover` link to essentially add more functionality and keyboard interactiveity to a standard popover node.
This abstraction enables us to create more complex popovers that can be easily integrated into component models (e.g. `<DropdownMenu />`, and `<DropdownNav />`).

This hook is utilized in any `DropdownXXX` component, but also allows the user to easily integrate the dropdown functionality (arrows, positioning, viewport
collision detection, etc...) into any other Component or HTML node that requires it.

### Why not use `usePopover`?

[On top of all of the reasons for using the `usePopover` hook](./hooks.usePopover.mdx), there are additional reasons we would use this hook instead of just simply the `usePopover`.

1. **Positioning** - Depending upon the options that are declared with the `useDropdown` hook, a set of styles and CSS variable tokens are created to easily position the `popover` close to it's target. This kind of automatic style calculation falls outside of the Popover API specification.
2. **Arrows** - It's a common treatment to see arrows included with popovers to indicate where the target was that launched it. This hook calculates the poisitoin of the arrow based upon size and positioning.
   {/* 4. **Keyboard Functionality** - By their nature, Popovers lack the typeof semantics that a dialog would. This hook adds some accessible and default listeners to make your dropdown behave as you would expect it would. */}
