# usePortal

Returns a `<Portal />` component and imperative controls to launch and create a nested React component
outside of the current DOM tree.

The example below gives you an understanding of how to manage the portal as well as position the portal relative
to the target that instantiated it.

{/* example:"src/hooks/usePortal/examples/UsePortal.example.tsx" */}

## Usages

This hook utilizes the [useDynamicNode](./hooks.useDynamicNode.mdx) hook to create a node at the root of the document
in which to attach a React portal to. Imperative functions are also exported along with the component to easily manage
when the portal should render it's children and when not to.\_createMdxContent

By default, this component hides the content of the portal from the DOM until it reaches an `isOpen` state. Once `isOpen=true`
then the portal will create a dynamic node, attach it to the root of the DOM and then render the children of the portal into that
dynamic node.

> **NOTE** It's important to note that since the DOM node is being placed outside of the current tree, any relatively or inherited
> styling will not apply. It's up to the developer to position the content of the portal where it should go.
