for creating a bubble near a focusable target to provide clarifying
or auxialry information to the user surrounding the use of that target.

## Examples

### Barebones

### Toggletip

A toggle tip is exactly the same thing as a tooltip in what it surfaces, but it replaces an action
that would normally be associated with the button and instead uses the click event to surface the tooltip.

This is espcially helpful when you want to click on something and reveal some content instead of hovering/
mousing over the content to view it.

You can easily enable this functionality by changing the `dxStrategy` in the `useTooltip` hook.

{/* example:"src/hooks/useTooltip/examples/UseTooltipToggletip.example.tsx" */}

### Accessible burst count

Naturally, as with any application, there are instances where actions are going to be ambiguous
which thus makes a target ambiguous. Let's take a "like" button for instance shown in the example below.

{/* example:"src/hooks/useTooltip/examples/UseTooltipWithCount.example.tsx" */}

There is a primary action which associated with _**smashing that like button**_, but to screen readers it's not
ultimately clear unless we add some more content.

Luckily, we can add another `id` to the content inside of the button to further context how many likes
there are associated with that button. You can see that the `dxLabeledBy` prop takes in a space delimaited
value which tells the screen reader how to interpret the button.

```ts
const { targetProps, tooltipProps } = useTooltip({
  id: "likes-label",
  dxType: "label",
  // readers find the ids and then read them sequentually
  dxLabeledBy: "likes-count likes-label",
  dxPosition: "top-center",
  dxArrow: {
    size: 8,
    color: "black",
  },
});
```
