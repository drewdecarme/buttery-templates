# `useTooltip`

A fully accessible, semantically correct, and SSR enabled hook
for creating a bubble near a focusable target to provide clarifying
or auxialry information to the user surrounding the use of that target.

{/* fence:"src/hooks/useTooltip/examples/UseTooltip.code.tsx" */}

The `useTooltip` hook is an extension of the [useDropdown](./hooks.useDropdown.mdx) hook that internally uses the [usePopover](./hooks.usePopover.mdx)
hook to turn the `tooltip` target into a [Popover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API). The `useDropdown` hook enables us to easily position the tooltip around the target
element.

## Types

There are two kinds of tooltips that each have specific accessibility requirements depending upon how they're used and then impelemneted.

> For accessibility purposes, the only node that can launch any kind of tooltip is the `<button />` element.

### Tooltip

This is the standard tooltip which surfaces a bubble near a actionable element that either labels or describes the action that
is associated with it. Since the action is fired using `onClick`, a tooltip is launched using `focus|blur|mouseOver|mouseOut`.

This is very helpful when an action is ambiguous and it needs further content to describe or label it.

Eaxmples of this include but aren't limited to:

- Icon only buttons that do something
- Icon only buttons that do something and also display the status of something (i.e. "like" button and count on social media)
- Collapsed navigation buttons
- Dense toolbar buttons that aren't immediately clear of what their pupose is.

You can easily enable this functionality by changing the `dxType="tooltip"` in the `useTooltip` hook.

{/* example:"src/hooks/useTooltip/examples/UseTooltip.example.tsx" */}

### Toggletip

This is a type of tooltip that surfaces a bubble near an actionable element that only reveals information supplementary; it does not have an
action associated with it since the toggle tip is launched via `onClick`. It's basically the same thing as a tooltip however the only function
is to provide more information that contexts an adjacent element or concept

This is espcially helpful when you want to click on something and reveal some content instead of hovering/
mousing over the content to view it.

Examples of this include but aren't limited to:

- Information icons near a group of elements to describe a purpose
- Icon inline with a text intput to provide more information about the input's nature or requirements

You can easily enable this functionality by changing the `dxType="toggletip"` in the `useTooltip` hook.

{/* example:"src/hooks/useTooltip/examples/UseTooltipToggletip.example.tsx" */}

## Styling

## Examples

### Barebones

### Accessible burst count

Naturally, as with any application, there are instances where actions are going to be ambiguous
which thus makes a target ambiguous. Let's take a "like" button for instance shown in the example below.

{/* example:"src/hooks/useTooltip/examples/UseTooltipWithCount.example.tsx" */}

There is a primary action which associated with _**smashing that like button**_, but to screen readers it's not
ultimately clear unless we add some more content.

Luckily, we can add another `id` to the content inside of the button to further context how many likes
there are associated with that button. You can see that the `dxLabeledBy` prop takes in a space delimaited
value which tells the screen reader how to interpret the button.

```ts
const { targetProps, tooltipProps } = useTooltip({
  id: "likes-label",
  dxType: "label",
  // readers find the ids and then read them sequentually
  dxLabeledBy: "likes-count likes-label",
  dxPosition: "top-center",
  dxArrow: {
    size: 8,
    color: "black",
  },
});
```
