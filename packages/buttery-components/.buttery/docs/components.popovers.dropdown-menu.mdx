# Dropdown Menu

An abstraction that that extends upon the `useDropdown` hook to easily
add accessible, keyboard and mouse aware, SSR ready, flyout & context menus.

This component provides some easy tools for creating context menus, flyout menus,
or any other menu that can be used to provide the user options for "doing more things"
in context to the actions already provided.

{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-menu/examples/DropdownMenu.example.tsx" */}

This specific abstraction provides support when you would like to offer the user a list of actions to do something; not
to navigate somewhere

> **NOTE:** It's important to note that this should be used when you want the user **to do something**; not to **go somewhere**.
> If you're looking to provide some functionailty that isn't a navigation event, then you should consider using the
> the [DropdownNav](./components.popovers.dropdown-nav.mdx) component.

The `useDropdownMenu` employs the use of [Portals](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal),(as implemented in
the [usePortal](./hooks.usePortal.mdx) hook) as well as Dynamic Node Creation (as implemented in the [useDynamicNode](./hooks.useDynamicNode.mdx)
hook). The use of the mechanisms gives us the combined functaiontliy list below.\_createMdxContent

The `<DropdownMenu />` component...

1. Render's the menu outside the context of the HTML heirarchy
2. Focuses the user's attention to the first actionable Node
3. Enables the abilitilly to reduce the client bundle down by providing support code-splitting the content of the dropdown.

## Usage

The `<DropdownMenu />` and the `useDropdownMenu` component and hook attempt to provide
an out of the box way to easily and simply add any type of context or inline menu to a
focusable element on the page.

The below implementation is the `useDropdownMenu` at it's most basic.

{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-nav/examples/DropdownNavBarebones.example.tsx" */}

The `useDropdownMenu` hook has the exact same API as the `useDropdown` hook except that it
requires an ID in order to link the `<button />` to the `<DropdownMenu />` componnet.

## Why not just `useDropdown`?

The `useDropdownMenu` hook allows for all of the same options that the `useDropdown` hook allows for
but the `useDropdownMenu` hook and the `<DropdownMenu />` component enahnce the existing functionality
to make the nodes fully acessible as well as automatically add the keyboard events that users expect
from any menu experience.

The `useDropdownMenu` hook is just an extension of the `useDropdown` hook to make reptetive elemnets of
a web experience just a little bit easier and faster to implement.

And this is true of the other `useDropdownXXXX` hooks and components.

## Why not just `useDropdownNav`?

The `useDropdownNav` is used exlcusively for providing a dropdowndown mechanism that is used to take
the user to a different part of the app instead of providing more actions to do in the context of the
users current page.

On top of the automatic event and listener support, the `<DropdownMenu />` also employs the use of the [usePortal](./hooks.usePortal.mdx)
hook to render the menu content in the portal. Due to this, the content of the menu will not be able to be
crawled.

## Examples

### Barebones

This is the most basic instance you can get (that is without any styling)
{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-menu/examples/DropdownMenuBarebones.example.tsx" */}

### With Offset

You can add a space between the target and the dropdown by adding a `dxOffset` option to the
`useDropdownMenu` hook.
{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-menu/examples/DropdownMenuWithOffset.example.tsx" */}

### With Arrow

You can add an arrow between the target and the dropdown by adding a `dxArrow` option to the
`useDropdownMenu` hook.
{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-menu/examples/DropdownMenuWithArrow.example.tsx" */}

### Positioning

You can position the element anywhere surrounding the target
{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-menu/examples/DropdownMenuPositions.example.tsx" */}

### Menu Groups

It's a common pattern to see context menus or any flyout menu to contain different groupings
based upon the semantic actions that are being provided.

For instance, you could have a context menu that has email functionality. 1 group could be with
replying, forwarding, etc... and another group could be with actions to take specific on the email
like archive or delete.

Since this component is completely headless, it's utlimatley up to you how you implement each of the
groups but a best practice is to group each action group using an unordered list. After that, it's all
up to how it's styled.

{/* example:"src/popovers/dropdown-menu/examples/DropdownMenuGroups.example.tsx" */}
