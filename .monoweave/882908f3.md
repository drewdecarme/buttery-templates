This changeset fixes some bugs with the bundling and transpilation of the assets needed to be run from the CLI. It's another step to providing the full mono-repo stability while dog-fooding the rest of the application.

- `@buttery/builtins` - Adds full type-safety to the `inlineTryCatch` function
- `@buttery/cli` - Adds docs to the buttery tools documentation
- Organizes the docs in the CLI package
- `@buttery/core` - Changes the to resolve files using `NodeNext` which requires file extensions on imports. This allows the CLI to reference barrel imports as well as singular file imports while running in a purely node context.
- `@buttery/docs` - Re-loads the manifest and graph when files are added and changed by correctly invalidating the virtual modules.
