"@buttery/docs": patch
---

Removes the inclusion of the `@buttery/tokens/docs` CSS file since it is being built at build time and then statically supplied to the development server of the `@buttery/docs` app. This will fix a runtime error in DEV and PROD instances where the browser is looking for a file that doesn't exist.
