This changeset primarily focuses on changing some of the logic to resolve the buttery directory in directory structures outside of the mono-repo. The logic was updated to look for a buttery directory each time a node_modules directory was located up the structure. Once it's found it then attempts to find the target that it was looking for.

In addition, a required configuration parameter was added to the script so the logLevel that was passed into into the script was then reflected in the `@buttery/core` logger. This allows us to debug the resolution of the buttery module at CLI runtime.
