Adds a new `@buttery/docs` API called `add` which allows you to either programmatically or via the `@buttery/cli` to add a new buttery doc by means of a few prompts.

```bash
buttery docs add <relative-path-to-.buttery/docs>
```

It has support for an optional boolean argument `--template, -t` to create the new doc based upon one of the [The Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/template) templates.

```bash
buttery docs add <relative-path-to-.buttery/docs> --template
```
