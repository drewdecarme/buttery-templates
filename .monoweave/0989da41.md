This changeset completely re-writes the `@buttery/commands` package from the ground up. Previously, the framework would look at a few directories, read some values and then create a `commander` program that would be built to the `bin` directory of the package that you we're working in.

Now, `@buttery/commands` no longer relies on `commander` to act as the runner and instead strips out a lot of the heavy packages to create a much lighter, leaner and more performant CLI framework. For starters, a static manifest is created every time you build your CLI. This offers a way more performant runtime where **all** of the validation is done at build time and the runtime is leaves it up to the implementer to log, throw, or validate the commands. In addition this also allows to create custom runtime's or deployment targets since the main sauce behind buttery commands it the compiled manifest.

In addition, this release adds a script to the `@buttery/docs` named `add` which allows you to easily add new buttery docs based upon the best practices established by the [Good Docs Project]()

```bash
buttery docs add <path-relative-to-/.buttery/docs> --template
```

This will prompt the user with a few questions on the file as well as what template should be applied.
