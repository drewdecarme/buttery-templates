This changeset removes some values from the `@buttery/commands` manifest due to misuse in CI. Previously the values that were generated in the manifest we're absolute strings which we're being malformed when generated in the CI runner.

The variables that were being created were file paths that were used to help reconcile the location of the runtime module that was created. This changeset removes the `pathSrc` and `pathOut` from the command manifest and adds `pathCmdModule` which is a relative path of the specific command module that is being used for that command.
